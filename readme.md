## Description

_{ A JS version of the classic children's memory game. 4 different colors and matching sounds are played generated in random order by the game. The game starts with one color/sound and one is added until 20 where the game is won by the player. In normal mode, if the player makes a mistake the computer will repeat the steps so far unlimited time until the player enters them in the right order. In strict mode, one mistake and the computer goes back to the first level and generates a new sequence.  }_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

_{Setup is pretty simple. Download the files and open index.html. There are CDN's included so an internet connection to allow the files to download is suggested.}_

## Known Bugs

_{ If the game is in "Off" mode and one of the color keys is pressed, the game will start, with an error, but the off button will not move.}_
